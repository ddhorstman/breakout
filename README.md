# Breakout
A clone of the 70's classic *Breakout* built over one week as my very first programming project. Built in Processing.
Features include:
- Intelligent hit detection that safely handles multiple simultaneous collisions
- Scaling difficulty across an infinite number of levels
- Configurable level layout
- Multiple control schemes
- Scoring and life systems
- A smart but fallible AI player that mimics human play patterns
